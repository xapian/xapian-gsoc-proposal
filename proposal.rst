.. 
.. See our GSoC Project Ideas List for some suggested project ideas:
.. https://trac.xapian.org/wiki/GSoCProjectIdeas
..
.. You are also most welcome to propose a project based on your own ideas.
.. 
.. From experience the best proposals are ones that are discussed with us and
.. improved in response to feedback.  You can share draft applications with
.. us by forking the git repository containing this file, filling in where
.. it says "FILLME", committing your changes and pushing them to your fork,
.. then opening a pull request to request us to review your draft proposal.
.. Please pick a useful title for the pull request - "My application" may
.. be meaningful to you, but isn't helpful to those reviewing.  Using the
.. title of the project is a good choice.  You can open a pull request even
.. before applications officially open.
.. 
.. IMPORTANT: Your application is only valid is you upload a PDF of your
.. proposal to the GSoC website at https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ - you
.. can generate a PDF of this proposal using "make pdf".  You can update the
.. "final" PDF proposal as many times as you want right up to the deadline by
.. just uploading a new file, so don't leave it until the last minute to upload
.. a version.  The deadline is strictly enforced by Google, with no exceptions
.. no matter how creative your excuse.
.. 
.. If there is additional information which we haven't explicitly asked for
.. which you think is relevant, feel free to include it. For instance, since
.. work on Xapian often draws on academic research, it's important to cite
.. suitable references both to support any position you take (such as
.. 'algorithm X is considered to perform better than algorithm Y') and to show
.. which ideas underpin your project, and how you've had to develop them
.. further to make them practical for Xapian.
..
.. For academic research, it's helpful to include a URL if the paper is
.. freely available online (via an author's website or preprint server,
.. for instance). Not all Xapian contributors have free access to academic
.. publishers. You should still provide all the normal information used
.. when citing academic papers.
.. 
.. You're welcome to include diagrams or other images if you think they're
.. helpful - for how to do this see:
.. https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#images
.. 
.. Please take care to address all relevant questions - attention to detail
.. is important when working with computers!
.. 
.. If you have any questions, feel free to come and chat with us on IRC, or
.. send a mail to the mailing lists.  To answer a very common question, it's
.. the mentors who between them decide which proposals to accept - Google just
.. tell us HOW MANY we can accept (and they tell us that AFTER student
.. applications close).
..

.. good application:

 * Name: Selin

 * E-mail address: seliin.kurttt@gmail.com

 * Biography:

    I was born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1998. I am a Computer Engineering student in Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University, Turkey. Computer Engineering excites me a lot and I am glad to choose this department. I am interested in open source software development and participating GSoC is one of my biggest aim. I am doing windsurfing as an amateur for two years. I voluntarily participate in social projects which aims to help people.


Background Information
----------------------

.. The answers to these questions help us understand you better, so that we can
.. help ensure you have an appropriately scoped project and match you up with a
.. suitable mentor or mentors.  So please be honest - it's OK if you don't have
.. much experience, but it's a problem if we aren't aware of that and propose
.. an overly ambitious project.

**Have you taken part in GSoC and/or GCI (https://codein.withgoogle.com/) and/or
similar programmes before?  If so, tell us about how it went, and any areas you
would have liked more help with.**

	I have not take part in such projects.

**Please tell us about any previous experience you have with Xapian, or other
systems for indexed text search.**

	I didn't have enough time to contribute because I just met with Xapian. I will make good use of the time up to the student selection process and contribute to Xapian.

**Tell us about any previous experience with Free Software and Open Source
other than Xapian.**

	I joined Hacktoberfest.

**What other relevant prior experience do you have (courses taken at college,
hobbies, holiday jobs, etc)?**

	I have learned Golang by myself and I worked with Golang in my internship. I worked on developing a web crawler with Go for 3 months in my internship. The programming languages ​​I learned at school are Python, C, and Java. I learned a little by studying C++ myself. I took many courses at school such as object oriented programming, operating systems, database management systems etc.(These are available in my transcript.)	


**What development platforms, tools and methods do you prefer to use?**

	I use Ubuntu and I do my daily works on the console. I use Vim for writing code. I use Git.

**Have you previously worked on a project of a similar scope?  If so, tell us
about it.**

	I have never used SWIG but I heard a lot about it. I don't think that I worked on a such project but I'm familiar with Go and C so I think I can learn the other requirements quickly.

**What timezone will you be in during the coding period?**

.. Please give at least the offset from GMT, but ideally also the timezone
.. name so we aren't surprised by any differences around daylight savings
.. time, which don't all line up in different parts of the world.

	I will be GMT+03:00 timezone.

**Will your Summer of Code project be the main focus of your time during the
program?**

	My project will be the main focus for me. I am ready and willing to devote all my time to this project.


**Expected work hours (e.g. Monday–Friday 9am–5pm UTC)**

.. A common mistake is to think you can work a huge number of hours per week
.. for the entire duration of Summer of Code. If you try, you run the risk of
.. making yourself exhausted or ill, which may mean you are unable to keep
.. working right the way through. It's important to take good care of
.. yourself. Make sure you leave adequate time for other commitments, as well
.. as for eating, exercising, sleeping and socialising. Summer of Code
.. doesn't have to take over your life; it's better to think of it as you
.. would a job, leaving time to do other things.
..
.. If you have commitments for particular periods of Summer of Code, such as
.. exams or personal or family events, then please note in your timeline
.. (further down) when you'll be unable to work on your project. Providing
.. these are few, it is usually possible to get enough done across Summer of
.. Code to make for a worthwhile project.

	Monday-Friday 8a.m-4p.m UTC

**Are you applying for other projects in GSoC this year?  If so, with which
organisation(s)?**

	I did not apply for another project.


Your Project
============

Motivations
-----------

**Why have you chosen this particular project?**

	Preferably I have wanted to work with the project which uses Golang. I looked at which organizations have projects related to Go. I examined the organizations and I determined that your project is the most appropriate project for me. I have trusted myself that I could do and complete this project.


**Who will benefit from your project and in what ways?**

.. For example, think about the likely user-base, what they currently have to
.. do and how your project will improve things for them.

Project Details
---------------

.. Please go into plenty of detail in this section.

**Describe any existing work and concepts on which your project is based.**

	I have studied with Golang in my internship. I worked on developing a software that makes web crawling.	I used PostgreSQL and Beego in this project.


**Do you have any preliminary findings or results which suggest that your
approach is possible and likely to succeed?**

-

**What other approaches have you considered, and why did you reject those in
favour of your chosen approach?**

	I thought of finding only the best fit for the approaches.

**Please note any uncertainties or aspects which depend on further research or investigation.**

FILLME

**How useful will your results be when not everything works out exactly as
planned?**

	I think my results will be useful because I don't lose motivation in a stress situation.

Project Timeline
----------------

.. We want you to think about the order you will work on your project, and
.. how long you think each part will take.  The parts should be AT MOST a
.. week long, or else you won't be able to realistically judge how long
.. they might take.  Even a week is too long really.  Try to break larger
.. tasks down into sub-tasks.
.. 
.. The timeline helps both you and us to know what you should do next, and how
.. on track you are.  Your plan certainly isn't set in stone - as you work on
.. your project, it may become clear that it is better to work on aspects in a
.. different order, or you may some things take longer than expected, and the
.. scope of the project may need to be adjusted.  If you think that's the
.. case during the project, it's better to talk to us about it sooner rather
.. than later.
.. 
.. You should strive to break your project down into a series of stages each of
.. which is in turn divided into the implementation, testing, and documenting of
.. a part of your project. What we're ideally looking for is for each stage to
.. be completed and merged in turn, so that it can be included in a future
.. release of Xapian. Even if you don't manage to achieve everything you
.. planned to, the stages you do complete are more likely to be useful if
.. you've structured your project that way. It also allows us to reliably
.. determine your progress, and should be more satisfying for you - you'll be
.. able to see that you've achieved something useful much sooner!
.. 
.. Look at the dates in the timeline:
.. https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/
.. 
.. There are about 3 weeks of "community bonding" after accepted students are
.. announced.  During this time you should aim to complete any further research
.. or other issues which need to be done before you can start coding, and to
.. continue to get familiar with the code you'll be working on.  Your mentors
.. are there to help you with this.  We realise that many students have classes
.. and/or exams in this time, so we certainly aren't expecting full time work
.. on your project, but you should aim to complete preliminary work such that
.. you can actually start coding at the start of the coding period.
.. 
.. The coding period is broken into three blocks of about 4 weeks each, with
.. an evaluation after each block.  The evaluations are to help keep you on
.. track, and consist of brief evaluation forms sent to GSoC by both the
.. student and the mentor, and a chance to explicitly review how your project
.. is going with Xapian mentors.
.. 
.. If you will have other commitments during the project time (for example,
.. any university classes or exams, vacations, etc), make sure you include them
.. in your project timeline.

FILLME

Previous Discussion of your Project
-----------------------------------

.. If you have discussed your project on our mailing lists please provide a
.. link to the discussion in the list archives.  If you've discussed it on
.. IRC, please say so (and the IRC handle you used if not the one given
.. above).
..
.. One of the things we've discovered sets apart many of the best applications
.. is that the students in question have discussed the project with us before
.. submitting their proposal.

	I haven't discuss my project.

Licensing of your contributions to Xapian
-----------------------------------------

**Do you agree to dual-license all your contributions to Xapian under the GNU
GPL version 2 and all later versions, and the MIT/X licence?**

For the avoidance of doubt this includes all contributions to our wiki, mailing
lists and documentation, including anything you write in your project's wiki
pages.

.. For more details, including the rationale for this with respect to code,
.. please see the "License grant" section of our developer guide:
.. https://xapian-developer-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing-changes.html#license-grant

	Yes, I agree.

Use of Existing Code
--------------------

**If you already know about existing code you plan to incorporate or libraries
you plan to use, please give details.**

.. Code reuse is often a desirable thing, but we need to have a clear
.. provenance for the code in our repository, and to ensure any dependencies
.. don't have conflicting licenses.  So if you plan to use or end up using code
.. which you didn't write yourself as part of the project, it is very important
.. to clearly identify that code (and keep existing licensing and copyright
.. details intact), and to check with the mentors that it is OK to use.

	I can not give a clear answer to this question as I have not completed reviewing libraries.
