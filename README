Please read the information on our wiki about using this proposal template:

https://trac.xapian.org/wiki/GSoCApplicationTemplate

and the comments at the top of proposal.rst for more information:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xapian/xapian-gsoc-proposal/master/proposal.rst

In particular, you should note that it is much easier for us to provide feedback on proposals
if you open a pull request in github, rather than simply pushing commits to your fork.
